This program will calculate miles per gallon
from liters to gallons.


Enter number of liters: 12.9

Enter number of miles: 100

With 12.90 liters and 100.00 miles,
the miles per gallon would be 29.34

Do you want to do another calculation(Y/N)? y


Enter number of liters: 15.2

Enter number of miles: 100

With 15.20 liters and 100.00 miles,
the miles per gallon would be 24.90

Do you want to do another calculation(Y/N)? y


Enter number of liters: 32.2

Enter number of miles: 250.5

With 32.20 liters and 250.50 miles,
the miles per gallon would be 29.45

Do you want to do another calculation(Y/N)? y


Enter number of liters: 37.8

Enter number of miles: 250.5

With 37.80 liters and 250.50 miles,
the miles per gallon would be 25.09

Do you want to do another calculation(Y/N)? n
